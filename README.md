## 🛒 Description

A lightweight WooCommerce plugin that automatically moves out-of-stock products to the end of product listings. It also allows applying a custom CSS filter (like grayscale or blur) to out-of-stock product images — and all of this can be toggled on or off from a simple admin panel.

## ✨ Features

- Automatically move out-of-stock products to the bottom of shop/category pages
- Apply custom CSS filters (e.g., `grayscale`, `blur`, etc.) to out-of-stock product thumbnails
- Enable or disable the plugin's effect via a settings page
- Lightweight, no bloat, built specifically for performance

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Download or clone the repository into your `wp-content/plugins/move-out-of-stock-products` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin dashboard.
3. Go to `Settings > Move Out of Stock` and configure the options.

## 🧰 Usage

- Check the "Enable plugin" box to activate its functionality.
- Enter a CSS filter value like `grayscale(100%)`, `blur(2px)`, or any valid CSS `filter` style to apply on out-of-stock products.
